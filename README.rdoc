== README (if you want)

The Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl is an extensive introductory tutorial on RoR. During the tutorial I created a small application with Twitter-like functionality where users can sign-up, sign-in, create microposts, follow other users and see their microposts in their "feed". 

The tutorial covers many aspects of Ruby on Rails, including models, views, controllers, templates, partials, filters, validations, callbacks, has_many/belongs_to and has_many through associations, security, testing, and deployment.

The first commit of this repository was made at exactly the end of the tutorial (section 11.4) and contains all the extentions to the above application that were developed by me alone, for practise (section 11.4.1).
